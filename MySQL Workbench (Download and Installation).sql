# Step - 1.MySQL Workbench (Download and Installation)


# MySQL Workbench is a unified visual database designing or graphical user interface tool 
used for working with database architects, developers, and Database Administrators. 
It is developed and maintained by Oracle. It provides SQL development, data modeling, data migration, and 
comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and many more.
 We can use this Server Administration for creating new physical data models, E-R diagrams, 
 and for SQL development (run queries, etc.). It is available for all major operating systems 
 like Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. MySQL Workbench fully supports MySQL Server version v5.6 and higher.

# MySQL Workbench covers five main functionalities, which are given below:

# SQL Development: This functionality provides the capability that enables you to execute SQL queries, 
create and manage connections to the database Servers with the help of built-in SQL editor.

# Data Modelling (Design): This functionality provides the capability that enables you to create models of 
the database Schema graphically, performs reverse and forward engineering between a Schema and a live database, 
and edit all aspects of the database using the comprehensive Table editor. The Table editor gives the facilities for editing tables, columns, indexes, views, triggers, partitioning, etc.

# Server Administration: This functionality enables you to administer MySQL Server instances by administering users, 
inspecting audit data, viewing database health, performing backup and recovery, 
and monitoring the performance of MySQL Server.

# Data Migration: This functionality allows you to migrate from Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Microsoft Access, PostgreSQL, Sybase ASE, SQL Anywhere, 
and other RDBMS tables, objects, and data to MySQL. It also supports migrating from 
the previous versions of MySQL to the latest releases.

# MySQL Enterprise Supports: This functionality gives the support for Enterprise products such as
 MySQL firewall, MySQL Enterprise Backup, and MySQL Audit.
